        <li id="cancer">You should date: Cancer
          <p>
            Probably the best sign, seriously. Rockstar.
            <br>
            Strengths: Tenacious, highly imaginative, loyal, emotional, sympathetic, persuasive
            Weaknesses: Moody, pessimistic, suspicious, manipulative, insecure
            Cancer likes: Art, home-based hobbies, relaxing near or in water, helping loved ones, a good meal with friends
            Cancer dislikes: Strangers, any criticism of Mom, revealing of personal life

            Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to know. They are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer is sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very loyal and able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.

        <li id="virgo">You should date: Virgo
          <p>
            Great sign! Def second.
            <br>
            Strengths: Loyal, analytical, kind, hardworking, practical
            Weaknesses: Shyness, worry, overly critical of self and others, all work and no play
            Virgo likes: Animals, healthy food, books, nature, cleanliness
            Virgo dislikes: Rudeness, asking for help, taking center stage

            Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes them one of the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left to chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is a sign often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they wonâ€™t accept their feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name speaks well of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.
