          <p>
            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.

            Web design is a process of conceptualizing, planning, and building a collection of electronic files that determine the layout, colors, text styles, structure, graphics, images, and use of interactive features that deliver pages to your site visitors. Web Design is a crucial component in web development, and students who learn design will be able to engineer positive and interactive user experiences through innovative interfaces.

          <p>
              Whatever you do in life, programming knowledge will be helpful. But if you don't like the idea of working in front of a computer then maybe you should set out into the great beyond and slake some wanderlust before settling into Epicodus.
